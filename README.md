# js-password-generator

## Description

Since I started working with Javascript, I've learned that understanding data types is a key factor in accessing, reading, generating, and manipulating data. JavaScript data types such as numbers, strings, booleans, and arrays display data in a variety of ways, and I harnessed the capabilities of this data to create a password generator that can be utilized for any interface or login that requires a password.

## Installation

You can access this page with the following URL:

## Usage

Click on the Generate Password button and answer a series of prompt to set your password length (between 8 and 128 characters) and to include one or more of the following types of characters: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Once completed, the generated password will be displayed on screen.
