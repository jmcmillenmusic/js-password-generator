# js-password-generator

## Description

Since I started working with Javascript, I've learned that understanding data types is a key factor in accessing, reading, generating, and manipulating data. JavaScript data types such as numbers, strings, booleans, and arrays display data in a variety of ways, and I harnessed the capabilities of this data to create a password generator that can be utilized for any interface or login that requires a password.
